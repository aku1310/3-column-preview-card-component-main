## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first HTML & CSS based project. I learned how to use the basics of HTML and CSS such as positioning the elements, pseudo-classes, assigning active states etc. 


### Continued development

I would like to further practice positioning and transitioning the elements, using flexbox and using gridbox.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) - This helped me in using pseudo-classes and in CSS.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This resource helped me a lot in using flexbox and CSS.
